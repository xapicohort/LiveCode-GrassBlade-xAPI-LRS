 I updated the stack with the one that now has script only stack behaviors so we can track changes in code in git hub. So can you post this one in our repository.
 
 I have just recorded a video showing how I did this conversion.  I will upload that now.  Hope it is not too big.
 
 This is a video of how I created script only stacks to hold the object script that were stored within the  binary stackfile to this point.  The script only stacks are just plain text files that git hub can track changes to so we can see the history of changes, branch, commit, do pull requests etc. that is not possible if the scripts are in the binary stackfile.
